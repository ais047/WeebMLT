I was an orphan. One of the children entrusted to a church whose parents&#39; faces and names are unknown. He was a poor orphan who seemed to be everywhere. Since the church is run with a small amount of money, such as donations from people, it was difficult to feed all the orphans entrusted to it. Every day I can&#39;t get enough food even if I work or work. Hard bread and soup without ingredients were a gorgeous meal, and in bad times there were days when I couldn&#39;t eat. I didn&#39;t like that everyday, so I decided to risk my life and make money. At first, he used a wooden stick and a sword that couldn&#39;t be called a stone-shaving sword, and dealt with monsters outside the city. There may be monsters that even children can defeat, but I thought it was much better than working in a poor church. If you defeat the monsters, you can get the ingredients and meat, so if you sell it, you can make money, and if you bake the meat, you can use it as food. I thought this was the way to live. I learned that if you register in the Adventurer&#39;s Guild, quests to defeat various monsters will be arranged and you will get more money, I registered in the Adventurer&#39;s Guild that day. He stole the skills of a skilled adventurer, sometimes asked for teaching, and defeated goblins and other monsters one after another to raise his arms.
