{"translations":[{"detected_source_language":"JA","text":"I was an orphan. One of the children sent to a church where I never knew my parents' faces or names.\n\n\n\n　I was a poor orphan who could be found anywhere.\n\n\n\n　It was difficult to feed all the orphans who were entrusted to the church, because the church was run by the small amount of money donated by people.\n\n\n\n　Every day, no matter how hard they worked, they could not get enough food. Hard bread and soup without any ingredients were the most sumptuous meals, and there were days when they could not eat for several days.\n\n\n\n　I hated those days, so I decided to risk my life to earn money.\n\n\n\n　At first, I used a wooden stick and a stone sword to deal with the demons outside the city.\n\n\n\n　I thought it was much better than working in a poor church. If you defeat the demons, you can get materials and meat, you can sell them to make money, and if you cook the meat, you can make food. I figured this was the way I was going to live.\n\n\n\n　I knew that if I registered with the Adventurer's Guild, I would be offered various quests to defeat demons, and I would also be able to earn more money, so I registered with the Adventurer's Guild that day.\n\n\n\n　Stealing the skills of skilled adventurers and asking them to teach me, I defeated goblins and other demons one after another, improving my skills."}]}
