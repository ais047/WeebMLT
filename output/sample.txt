Asked him. 
“If you fight with King Kwon, who will win?” 
When I asked, his arrogant face was filled with interest. 

“Did you come here just to ask that?” 
“Because it&#39;s important to me.” 
“It’s fun.” 

He seemed to laugh at my question, but soon thought with a serious face. 
And after a long time, I slowly opened my mouth. 

“If I am prepared to sacrifice to some extent, I will win.” 
“If it’s a sacrifice… … ?” 
“I should give you an arm or a leg.” 
“Are you confident in winning?” 
He nodded to my question. 
“I am confident.” 
I took out the paper and drew a stroke on the paper. 
And I opened my mouth again. 
“Who will win if the Do-Kang and you get together?” 
“It’s the king of the road… … .” 
He smiled and opened his mouth without worrying. 

“I win again this time.” 

“Without any sacrifice?” He nodded. 
“It hasn&#39;t seen the wall yet. Now I can defeat him without any damage.” “What if you saw the wall?” “Then, likewise, you&#39;ll have to give out one arm or one leg.” “But you are confident in winning.” &quot;sure.&quot; I again drew another stroke on the paper. And asked again. “Then, what if the sword king and you get together?” Again, he was thinking. However, there was a long silence, unlike a little while ago. Only after that long he opened his mouth in a prudent tone.
